# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


In the project 0 foder you will find my index.html page as well a 4 additional HTML pages.
In the Index page I have my basic navigation which includes the second requirement which is an Unordered list. 
In the boone.html page you will find a table and there in an image in every page except the index page.
The styles.css page  is my styles sheet. In it there multiple selectors and css properties. 
You will find my @media query in the morelia.html page where the font color changes under 600px.
In the boone.html page is where I use the grid system, implementing 2 columns. 
I did not understand the process of installing SASS which in my reserch comes up as very similar to SCSS. Though I did undertand the concept of nesting in CSS
